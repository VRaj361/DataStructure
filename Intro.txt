-> if you use Array with doesn't give any argument that return grabage value


2) Structure

-> structure is the user defined data types where we will group together 
-> related data member  named as one name which is similar or disimilar type
-> which ever element is inilialized that sum is required for taken memory of structure
-> There are many ways to inilialized the value it's like a class create a obj like that


3) Pointer 

-> Pointer is use to access memory indirectly
-> One of the point is to access the heap memory which is outside the program
-> Pointer is use various places like in internal structure of OS to access the files to access hardware 
   components
-> Pointer use for accessing heap , accessing resources ,parameter passing
-> Pointer takes 8 byte memory for every data member for 64bit computer
-> so it's independent with data member variable
-> compiler can decide the value of taking the pointer
